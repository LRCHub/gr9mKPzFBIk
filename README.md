# I Prevail – Rain

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
It's getting hard to find a meaning
Go grab your knife,
it's killing season
I've buried all my friends
They all left me in the end
It's getting hard to find a meaning
I've watched you beg and plead
for sympathy
But now the well's run dry
So let it rain down,
wash over me
Come set me free
from this misery
Need a way out
of this apathy
Just set me free
from this misery
Let it rain
It's getting hard to find a meaning
When every smile feels like treason
I've pulled on every thread
There's no reason to pretend
It's getting hard to find a meaning
I've watched you beg and plead
for sympathy
But now the well's run dry
So let it rain down,
wash over me
Come set me free
from this misery
Need a way out
of this apathy
Just set me free
from this misery
Let it rain
In the wake of blood and thunder
You and I deserve each other
The hell above will drag us under
We were all just born to suffer
We were all just born to suffer, oh
So let it rain down,
wash over me
Come set me free
from this misery
Need a way out
of this apathy
Just set me free
from this misery
Let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain
